1
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,384
Go on, son. Have a bump.

2
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,644
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,689
- Homelander's gonna love this.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:27,611
Homelander has agreed to donate
to the Starlight House, which is...

5
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,946
- No. No.
- I mean, giv... Come on, give it up.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,866
- Give it up for this guy.
- No, no, no.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,118
I'm not just like the rest of you,

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,369
I'm better.

9
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:39,372
- Homelander is a fucking psychopath.
- Homelander is protecting them.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,418
You said you'd always looked out for me.
You promised!

11
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,130
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you.
- I hate you.

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,131
This little guy here is my son.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,508
Fuck you, fascist!

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,848
You help me out with one small favor,

15
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,433
and I'll help you.

16
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,978
- Do you have it or not?
- Original recipe, all 11 herbs and spices.

17
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,542
Just a pinch.

18
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,817
My name is Annie January,
and I fucking quit.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,194
I say you're one of the Boys.

20
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,614
You are like rabid little doggy,

21
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,115
but loyal to whoever holds this chain.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,117
Your brain's leaking.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,368
Temp V is gonna kill you both.

24
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,456
- How long I got?
- Months. 12 on the outside.

25
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,748
Homelander needs to die.

26
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,459
That's it. Whatever it takes.

27
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,710
Soldier Boy's our weapon.
He's how we kill Homelander.

28
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:26,712
Did you know?

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,631
That Soldier Boy was my father?

30
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,486
Get out of the building, now.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,137
Butcher, stop!

32
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:38,682
The thing you wanted, he's right
fucking there, and now you blink?

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,599
I made a promise.

34
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,268
You don't need me anymore.

35
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,269
I could jump.

36
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,938
You can fucking fly.

37
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,562
Good evening!

38
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,563
Now, look, I know it's a late night,

39
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,401
so I just wanted to come out
and say thanks for your patience.

40
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,152
The bar remains open, and, uh...

41
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,448
Oh, yeah, Colorado and Nevada
just went to Robert Singer!

42
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,701
Whoo!

43
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,665
So, stay tuned.

44
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,502
I feel like we're gonna be back very soon
with some very good news.

45
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,463
Thank you, and God bless America!

46
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,853
Motherfucking Gruyère puffs?

47
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,437
What am I supposed to do with these?

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,733
She says you've been working too hard.
You need to eat more.

49
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,735
We pull this off, I promise
I'll grub all these motherfuckers.

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,788
Hughie, come on. I need eyes.

51
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,393
Yeah, yeah,
just give me one... more second.

52
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,836
Sorry, sorry. There's, like, a million
connectors in here, and I can't see shit.

53
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,175
Are you helping,
or you just showing off?

54
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,510
Oh, for sure both.

55
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,347
Is that it?

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,807
All right, live and in living color.

57
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,645
Butcher, you copy?

58
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,356
Where the fuck is Butcher?

59
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:06,205
Oh, don't you fucking start. I'm fine.

60
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,289
Charcuter.

61
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,834
Who are you talking to?

62
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,086
I ain't said a word.

63
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,757
Geez.

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,428
All right.
Come on, then.

65
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,564
Evening, cunts.

66
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,651
We're here to commit
a bit of high treason.

67
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,867
Going up.

68
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,963
Hey, whoa, hey.

69
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,091
The plan is you wait here,
cover our exit, no?

70
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,761
Oh, come off it. Watch a fucking door?

71
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,639
Kimiko, if Butcher steps one foot
in that elevator, break his arm.

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,730
Please
remove obstruction from doors.

73
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,360
Fuck me.

74
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,954
Okay, big man, let's do this.

75
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,706
There's a lot of people in there.

76
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,545
Come on, kiddo.

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,591
Would you be scared
of a bunch of cockroaches? Huh?

78
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,468
Yeah.

79
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,512
Yeah.
Then baby chicks or whatever.

80
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,682
Look, the-the point is,
you have nothing to be nervous about.

81
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,019
Come on. We've talked about this.

82
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,312
They're only humans and...?

83
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,066
Toys for our amusement.

84
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,692
- That's right.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,069
We got this.

86
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,459
Hold up, hold up.

87
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,211
Okay, we got a problem.

88
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,798
W-Wait, what is... he doing here?

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,442
Homelander's in the building.

90
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,009
If you see him, do not engage. I repeat,

91
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,053
do not engage with Homelander.

92
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,930
That means you, Butcher, you copy?

93
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,891
My goodness,
you look beautiful this evening.

94
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,353
Especially you. Zoe, uh,
y-you remember my son, Ryan?

95
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,689
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

96
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,817
Hey, Zo, you know what? I heard that
this hotel makes its own ice cream.

97
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,944
Why don't you take Ryan
and try and find some, huh?

98
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,904
What a great idea. Go for it, sport.

99
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,031
Just nobody come back pregnant.

100
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,119
Just kidding.

101
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,163
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
They're too young. Although,

102
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,682
Ryan could spew goo if he wanted to.

103
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,542
What the fuck are you doing here?

104
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,752
Oh, I've supported
every new administration

105
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,670
for the past... 16 years.

106
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,923
I don't want your support.
You're on trial for fucking murder.

107
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,675
- Hi, Doug.
- One,

108
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,596
that's a formality, and two,
that's a clear-cut case of self-defense.

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,766
That thug threw a projectile at my son.

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,350
It was a plastic bottle.

111
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,894
Could've had anthrax in it.

112
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,497
Not that that would've hurt us,
but there was a principle at stake.

113
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:05,110
And, besides, when I took
that monster down, people applauded.

114
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,694
Your shareholders didn't.

115
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,531
Well, that's why
you and me are gonna prove to them

116
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,117
that even with a "soft on crime"
fucking libtard

117
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,577
- for a president...
- Mm.

118
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,915
it's gonna be
business as usual at Vought.

119
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,500
Any transaction you and I may
or may not have had is ancient history.

120
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,345
Well, then let's make some new history.

121
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,013
Ladies and gentlemen, Victoria Neuman.

122
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,157
Let's give her a round.

123
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,892
Huh?

124
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,769
Girls get it done in the White House.

125
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,105
Hmm? God bless you.

126
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,541
Give us a minute here, would you, love?

127
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,557
Listen, Ryan, I've got a lot to say...

128
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,351
and fuck all time to say it.

129
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,020
I got a lorry out back.
I can get you out of here.

130
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,208
- What are you talking about?
- I know you're angry at me, and you've got every right to be.

131
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,652
But you know how dangerous Homelander is.

132
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,403
- He's my dad.
- Right.

133
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,381
H-He murdered some poor sod
right in front of your eyes.

134
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,533
- That guy was a pedophile.
- It ain't true.

135
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,826
He-He's lying to you.

136
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,327
Let me take you to Grace, all right?

137
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,663
A-And then you
don't got to see me no more.

138
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,586
Please, I'm... I'm begging you.

139
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,629
It's what your mom would want.

140
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,049
No means no, William.

141
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,813
This isn't the Neverland Ranch.

142
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,806
Don't worry.
Nothing bad's gonna happen, right?

143
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,933
Oh.

144
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,062
Seems it already has.

145
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,985
Look at that big black mass
curdling around your brain.

146
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,865
What do you got, six months?

147
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,326
Less?

148
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,871
That's too bad. W-We're not gonna have
that last dance together.

149
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,874
I'll miss us.

150
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,918
Bloody hell.

151
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,711
You wank to your own voice, don't you?

152
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,673
That's the spirit, champ.

153
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,467
Son.

154
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,481
Come on. I do not want to
miss Smash Mouth.

155
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,546
So many pantsuits.

156
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,315
Mom?

157
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,586
What are you doing in here?

158
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,446
Apologies, Miss Neuman,

159
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,840
we're with your mother's detail.

160
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,365
Is that Zoe?

161
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,618
We'll be done in just a minute.

162
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,123
Why don't you wait outside.

163
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,606
- Frenchie, what's happening?
- She's a fucking Supe.

164
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,258
She's a fucking Supe!

165
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,846
Yeah, I guess I'll just, uh...

166
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,099
wait here.

167
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,230
It's okay.

168
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,565
We see nothing.

169
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,235
Ça va? Non ça va?

170
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,001
We need an exit, now!

171
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,176
There's a window
on the south end of the hallway.

172
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,015
Uh... We're eight stories up.

173
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,392
Frenchie, trust me.

174
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,841
- No!
- Frenchie!

175
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,510
Motherfucker.

176
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,649
Yes.

177
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,942
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, mon Dieu.

178
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,443
Oh, God.

179
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,779
Oh, gross.

180
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,753
Thank Christ. Can we go now? Jesus.

181
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,297
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

182
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,024
You got to teach Butcher
the meaning of the word "covert."

183
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,360
He just got made by a 12-year-old.

184
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,344
You mean Zoe, who just murdered two guys?

185
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,222
Vic, you-you shot your own daughter up
with V? How could you do that to her?

186
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,225
- I needed to keep her safe.
- Safe?

187
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,354
You turned her into a fucking monster.
Like you.

188
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,898
I'm sorry. That sounds like
the pot calling the kettle

189
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,649
a teleporting dude with his dick out.

190
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,777
Worst mistake I ever made.

191
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,407
Vic, you and me, we were...

192
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,159
We were like family. I mean...

193
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,371
was everything just... bullshit?

194
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,000
I almost told you once.

195
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,961
That night of the blackout, you remember?

196
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,881
You brought every bodega snack
you could carry for Zoe.

197
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,219
We played Uno with her for hours
until the lights came back on.

198
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,388
And I thought...

199
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,433
you were one of my closest friends.

200
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,312
I mean, hell, you're dating a Supe.

201
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,273
If anyone would understand,
it'd be you, right?

202
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,441
Why didn't you tell me?

203
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,567
I was scared.

204
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,235
Scared you'd have to pop my head.

205
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,113
I was scared to lose you.

206
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,370
I always cared about you, Hughie.

207
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,248
That part was real.

208
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,003
Hey, Vicky.

209
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,005
- Fuck you!
- Oh!

210
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,221
Seriously? Ugh.

211
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,475
I have to be on TV in, like,
ten minutes, you fucking asshole.

212
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,038
We're gonna out you. We're gonna go to
the press, tell them you blew up Congress.

213
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,581
I still, I still got the Red River files.

214
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,404
Okay, okay, okay.
Have you ever seen WarGames?

215
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,835
What am I saying, look at you,
of course you've seen fucking WarGames.

216
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,403
- We're making jokes?
- Mutually assured destruction.

217
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,989
I hurt you, you out me. You out me,

218
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,033
I kill everyone you've ever loved.

219
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,661
The only thing that makes sense
is a truce.

220
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,413
Or plan B.

221
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,085
Jesus fucking...

222
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,075
How is it you guys are actually
getting worse at your jobs?

223
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,472
Mm. They just called Arizona.

224
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,143
Guess I better go change.

225
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,043
Nice of you to show up.
Where the hell you been?

226
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,837
The bog. Trying to wash off
the stench of failure

227
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,172
from your cock-up last night.

228
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,966
Shut the fuck up, Butcher.

229
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,221
Grace.

230
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,850
- Not you.
- Oh, come off it.

231
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,519
I washed my bollocks and all.

232
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,187
- M?
- There are people who,

233
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,523
because of ignorance or maybe insanity,

234
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,693
still believe you have
something to contribute.

235
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,028
I'm not one of them.

236
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,865
I'll get the kid back, Grace.

237
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,741
I'll make it right.

238
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:23,542
Two agents from my detail are dead
at the hands of a 12-year-old.

239
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,213
We had to tell their families they snorted
fentanyl-laced cocaine at the after-party.

240
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,259
- Sir, our intel told us the acid would work on Neuman.
- She's no idiot.

241
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,970
She'll know I was behind it.

242
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,682
Goddamn it! Everyone told me
to pick Buttigieg instead.

243
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,476
You didn't know, sir. Marvin,

244
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,935
I vouched for you.
The CIA is bankrolling you.

245
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,520
All due respect, ma'am,

246
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,833
you can always put Butcher back in charge.
He's right outside.

247
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,817
What about Starlight?

248
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,193
She goes by Annie now.

249
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,779
Can Annie burn out Neuman's
fucking eyes, debilitate her?

250
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,924
If she can get close enough to her without
getting her head popped off, who knows?

251
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,869
But we might have to accept the
possibility that Neuman's... invulnerable.

252
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,580
Congress certifies the election January 6.

253
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,751
After that, a Supe is one heartbeat away
from the presidency.

254
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,711
My fucking heartbeat.

255
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,298
Now, I can only keep my distance
from her for so long.

256
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,468
Eliminating her is top priority.

257
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,053
So do your fucking job.

258
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,721
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,059
Fuck.

260
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,271
Somewhere else you need to be?

261
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,192
No, sir.

262
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,195
Billy Butcher.

263
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,365
Joe Kessler.

264
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,409
Fuck me. How long's it been?

265
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,246
Uh, I'd say 11 years,
but, officially speaking,

266
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,913
none of that shit show ever happened.

267
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,833
Then how come
I remember you high on opium,

268
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,209
rimming out the General's wife?

269
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,417
Well, fuck you.

270
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,840
Hey, let me buy you a bad cup of coffee.

271
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,051
Demoted from
your own fucking team.

272
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,636
What's your shitty code name again?

273
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,846
The Boys.

274
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,682
Oof. Who came up with that shit?

275
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,228
Why you putting up with it? Walk away.

276
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,272
No, my son, I've got plans and schemes.

277
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,108
I'll be back at the head
of the table in no time.

278
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,111
Well, you better.

279
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,172
You know, a lot of the guys are thinking
you got benched

280
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,490
at the worst possible time.

281
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,201
You know, Mallory's so focused
on killing the VP-Elect

282
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,413
'cause that's what Singer wants,
and half of goddamn Langley's on it.

283
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,540
Well, you know Grace, she's always
been a bit of a political animal.

284
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,375
And what are you focused on?

285
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,752
Homelander.

286
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:35,340
He killed that poor cunt in broad
daylight, and they fucking cheered.

287
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,969
I mean, what you think
that taught him, eh?

288
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,638
No.

289
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,349
We're whistling away
towards a fucking apocalypse,

290
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,894
and Grace's eye ain't on the ball.

291
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,688
You had a clean shot at him, right?

292
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,150
With Soldier Boy? You didn't take it.

293
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,568
Was your eye on the ball?

294
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,657
Why do I get the feeling
we ain't just bumped into each other?

295
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,743
You remember the Panjshir Valley?

296
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,999
Yeah. Pretty hard to forget.

297
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,044
You dragged me out of there
and dropped how many bodies to do it,

298
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,462
without giving it
a second fucking thought.

299
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,839
And yet you still didn't
name your son after me, eh?

300
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,720
We need someone like you, Billy.
Right fucking now.

301
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:25,016
Before the Supes start rounding us up
and dumping us off in camps.

302
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,232
Hey.

303
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,944
A tie? You going to prom?

304
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,034
- What's up?
- Janine.

305
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,912
She got into a fight at school.

306
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,289
Principal didn't say why,
just that she KO'd a boy.

307
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,375
A boy?

308
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,417
Don't you dare be proud right now.

309
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,878
She's been slamming doors, Marvin.

310
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,715
She told me to "eat a dick."

311
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,300
Janine said that?

312
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,471
She's been having a hard time
since Todd moved out.

313
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,740
You mean, since you kicked him out?

314
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,266
Let's dial down the glee
in your voice, but, yes,

315
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,769
since I kicked him out.

316
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,645
But Janine still loves him.

317
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,647
- She's worried.
- Worried about what?

318
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,943
Todd got so deep into
all that weird Hometeamer shit.

319
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,146
He's not answering my calls.
I don't know where he is.

320
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,114
Okay, so...?

321
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,740
And you're good at finding people.

322
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,450
Oh, come on. Monique...

323
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,576
For your daughter, Marvin.

324
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,713
Well, I get what you saw in that guy.
He was good to Janine.

325
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,718
'Cause it sure as shit
wasn't the D.

326
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,055
Right?

327
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,994
- You have to be good.
- You're my greatest failure.

328
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,355
It's your destiny.

329
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,260
It's because deep down
there's a part of you that is still...

330
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,285
human.

331
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,768
Don't get brazen with me.

332
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,468
You're not to refer to the deceased
as the "victim."

333
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,845
It's a loaded term
and for the jury to decide.

334
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,807
Sir, so I'm afraid we are behind
on the Tower Reconstruction,

335
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,185
but I can 100% assure you
that it is not my fault.

336
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,146
But it wasn't until
Annie January stepped out

337
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,981
from Vought's shadow, and Homelander's,

338
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,942
that we saw the true extent of her power.

339
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,612
Vought and Homelander
aren't above the law.

340
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,364
They can't just do whatever they want.

341
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:49,076
Deep, we got to talk
about the octopus in the room.

342
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,288
Your ex, Cassandra,
wrote a tell-all book...

343
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,848
I'm gonna have to stop you
right there, Hailey.

344
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,792
You know, there were no relations
with an octopus.

345
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,005
It's, uh, it's just a racist rumor
and a ridiculous lie

346
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,174
perpetuated by a jilted
and, uh...

347
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,469
emotionally unstable hysterical woman,

348
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,112
who, let's be clear, pooped in my bed.

349
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,847
Deep, please tell me
the fucking octopus is gone.

350
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,768
Yes, Ashley. She's...

351
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,854
It is taken care of. Okay?

352
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,314
Hey, Noir.

353
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,942
Sir,
after that debacle at Godolkin...

354
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,152
thank you again for saving my life...

355
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,796
the board felt we should find
new candidates for The Seven, ASAP.

356
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,115
The selection committee has

357
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,742
narrowed it down to 25 choices.

358
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,580
Um, okay, great.

359
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,917
If we're going purely on socials,
I might suggest Talon out of Redlands.

360
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,547
Pass. She's a butterface.

361
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,633
- Her body's on point, but her face...
- Yeah, I get it.

362
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,884
Thank you so much for explaining.

363
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,470
Chauvinist prick.

364
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,347
Ugh, not that slutty cum rag.

365
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,269
- Hold up, I thought he ate a dog.
- He ate out a dog.

366
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,855
It's a big difference.

367
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,984
Sister Sage? Hell no.

368
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,737
She was with me in Teenage Kix
for, like, barely a year

369
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,632
- before they canned her ass.
- What's her power?

370
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,825
She's the world's
smartest person.

371
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,536
She's not smart enough to know
when to shut her mouth.

372
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,996
Wrangler. Isn't he a...

373
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,749
Texas nutjob. The San Antonio office
had to cover up those migrant murders.

374
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,512
- I kind of like him.
- Of course,

375
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,086
he bumps us with suburban women
and white men over 50.

376
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,963
Amazing choice, sir.

377
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,840
Yeah, I totally agree. He's a mensch.

378
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,234
Did I use that word right? Mensch?

379
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,551
You just said he was crazy.

380
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,315
What I meant was
we would be crazy

381
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,263
to, you know, not bring him in.

382
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,107
I am surrounded by sycophants
and fucking imbeciles.

383
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,295
It's just that you make
a lot of really great points, sir.

384
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,487
Deep, just...

385
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,037
Blow A-Train.

386
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,664
What?

387
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,084
I'm not kidding.
Go over there, pull out

388
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,753
A-Train's cock and blow him.

389
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,970
Okay.

390
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,439
Get up.

391
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,587
Sex is just a spectrum,
right, bro?

392
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,673
Get off your fucking knees.

393
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,968
This is exactly

394
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,010
what I'm talking about. Not one of you

395
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,138
has the stomach
to challenge anything I say.

396
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,307
Oh, my God.

397
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,603
I have got to carry this entire
fucking company on my shoulders.

398
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,814
You're... right?

399
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,573
I wasn't gonna do it.

400
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,454
Homelander faces his toughest opponent
yet, our corrupt legal system.

401
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,457
Smash that donate button,
get a free tote...

402
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,835
Roland Keating attacked Homelander's son.

403
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,048
The magic of Vought on Ice,
coming December 7 at VoughtCoin Arena.

404
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,134
Things grew heated between the Starlighter

405
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,595
and Hometeamer movements
outside the courthouse today.

406
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,307
This creep had photos of his
quote-unquote "niece"

407
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,101
naked in the bathtub.

408
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,729
He's an antifa pedo who
fucked around and found out.

409
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,372
And "an eye for an eye" might be
in the Jew section of the Bible,

410
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,599
but it is still in the Bible.

411
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,123
Yes. Steady.

412
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,249
Good, good.

413
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:08,961
Yes.

414
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:14,383
Annie, that was awesome. Look, look.
It's a new record. 33 seconds.

415
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:18,679
Oh, amazing. I can fly 100 feet away
from all my cares.

416
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,722
And drain the power grid at the same time.

417
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,973
What would Greta say?

418
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,280
Six months of work, c'est merde!

419
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,325
So the acid didn't work.

420
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,369
We'll think of something else.

421
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,413
Like what? Yeah.

422
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:48,875
Hey, look, I-I-I totally agree
with whatever you said.

423
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,103
No one wants Neuman gone more than me,

424
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,337
and no one knows how dangerous
she is for the country.

425
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:56,717
Yeah, we may never get another shot
like that ever again...

426
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,969
- I am really bad at pep talks.
- Oh, you think?

427
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,390
All right, I'm out of here.

428
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,642
Recycling bin, motherfucker.

429
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,106
What?

430
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,818
- He blew our cover with Neuman.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,403
He almost got you killed again.

432
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,404
Uh-huh.

433
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,031
You're the only one that wants him here.

434
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,325
We should cut him loose.

435
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,786
We're not cutting him loose.

436
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,079
We're not cutting him loose.

437
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,388
Well, it's a fine time to fucking well
bring that up, innit?

438
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,607
It's gonna be a lot harder
to do a murder with them cunts around.

439
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,193
Them? Nah.

440
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,990
They're, uh, hand-picked,
sort of secret-secret service, so...

441
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,616
I'm surprised you called.

442
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,452
I'm full of surprises, ain't I?

443
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,246
What do you want?

444
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:12,250
Well, I was thinking that, uh, you and I
could scratch each other's backs.

445
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,503
Like when you shot me in the head?

446
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,465
I need a hand to get Ryan
away from Homelander.

447
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,134
Is that all?
Boy needs a father.

448
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,428
That cunt ain't no father.

449
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,510
And you are?

450
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,731
You're between a cock and a hard place.

451
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,401
I'm going to put you
into that posh VP slot,

452
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,694
and he's gonna make sure
you spend the next four years

453
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,072
grabbing your ankles
while he shoves it up your ass.

454
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,865
I think I can handle myself.

455
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,628
Oh, you mean that nasty little virus
they cooked you up at Godolkin?

456
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,998
Yeah, I know about it,

457
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,375
and I know it ain't strong enough
to kill Homelander yet.

458
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,128
And then there's the hard place.

459
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:02,092
The full weight of the CIA
and my Boys working 24/7 to top you.

460
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,761
You need me.

461
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:12,519
If I was even gonna think about this...

462
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,730
I'd want a show of good faith.

463
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,857
The material Hughie has on me
from the Red River Group Home.

464
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,777
That don't stop him
from going to the press.

465
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,903
Mm. Stops them from printing it.

466
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:26,616
Just a wild conspiracy theory
from a disgruntled former staffer.

467
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,037
Those are my terms.

468
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,332
You know where to find me.

469
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,846
Motherfucker.
I just logged in five minutes ago.

470
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,682
- What's happening?
- This shit.

471
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,726
Uh... Oh, okay, yeah, you got to hit

472
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,769
"Keep me logged in."

473
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,105
Sorry. Uh, yeah, "Keep me logged in."

474
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,527
But, uh, spoiler alert, that will not
keep you logged in.

475
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,509
This message
is for Hugh Campbell.

476
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,451
I'm calling again from New York
Central Hospital.

477
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,637
Your father was admitted...

478
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,957
Fuck. Fuck!

479
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,375
Kid?

480
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,422
Sorry.

481
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,507
Dad? I'm...

482
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:36,561
The Starlight House,
a so-called "home for at-risk teens."

483
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,646
Sure. And Jeff Epstein killed himself.

484
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,984
No, the only thing these teens are
at risk of is being groomed

485
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,697
and thrown into Starlight's
LGBTerror-dungeon.

486
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,699
Child Lives Matter, folks...

487
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,076
It'd be a lot easier to get
media coverage if you were there.

488
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,998
Homelander's verdict will
1,000% be innocent,

489
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,416
and I'm not showing up
to even dignify that shit.

490
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,961
Annie, I'm happy to organize the protest
and-and make the speech,

491
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,463
but no one wants to hear it

492
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,174
'cause it's the Starlighter Movement
and I'm not Starlight.

493
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,885
- Well, neither am I.
- Then, tell that to her.

494
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,266
The whole reason I quit was
to get away from her.

495
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,352
Now, you're killing it
with the Starlighters.

496
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,769
You don't need me.

497
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,189
If... just if... you were Starlight,

498
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,067
then maybe we'd drum up
some real donations.

499
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:28,196
I want to help, of course,
but as Annie January.

500
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,491
No one's donating to the Annie House.
It sounds like we sell raisin cookies.

501
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,242
Hey.

502
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,577
Hey.

503
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,330
So, Colin is annoying as hell,

504
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,500
but he has saved my ass
more than a few times

505
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,545
over the past few months,
so thank you for the rec.

506
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,881
- He's a champ.
- Oh, je t'en prie.

507
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:49,050
You know, I can tell this even
from our first group meeting.

508
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,345
Anonymous meetings.

509
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,137
Right there in the name.

510
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,269
- Excuse-moi.
- Mm-hmm.

511
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,531
Pardon.

512
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,079
I should not have brought up our meetings.

513
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,288
It's okay.

514
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,335
I love my boss knowing
I'm an ex-junkie.

515
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,380
Shit.

516
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,179
I am almost never surprised.

517
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,224
May I come in?

518
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,190
- Sister Sage.
- Just Sage.

519
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,068
Right.

520
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,277
Vought added the "Sister" part.

521
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,489
Can't have one of us
without a racial qualifier.

522
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,907
- Ha.
- Never seen you without the suit.

523
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,827
Why incognito?

524
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,762
You know, I would've thought
the smartest woman on Earth

525
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,579
would have a nicer place.

526
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,956
Smartest person,

527
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,585
and that person's too smart
to give a fuck about Pottery Barn.

528
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,920
Okay. Preach, sister.

529
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,213
Well, um...

530
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,884
You're so smart.

531
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,969
Show me.

532
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,054
Show me.

533
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,811
Based on your public appearances,

534
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,938
your stylist is
dying your hair more often.

535
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,942
Used to be every month,
now it's every 2.4 weeks.

536
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,525
Did she tell you you're going gray,

537
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,068
or is she hiding it?

538
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,237
So between that
and your enlarged prostate...

539
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,030
- My fucking what?
- Look at your hands.

540
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,242
You've been washing them more often,

541
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,994
so likely you've been
peeing more often, which makes sense.

542
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,914
You got a lot of power, but you do age.

543
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:10,293
Plus, there's that small matter
your own father almost killed you.

544
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,420
Wow.

545
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,844
Any mouth breather could see you're
going through some existential midlife...

546
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,262
whatever.

547
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,307
Pretty ballsy for someone
whose power is a party trick.

548
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,476
You are welcome to laser me,

549
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,228
but I'm guessing you need me
and my party trick for something.

550
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,815
Hmm.

551
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,067
I need advice.

552
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,237
From someone on my level.

553
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,367
Of course, if you breathe a word of this,
I'll pull you apart bit by bit.

554
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,451
Naturally.

555
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:47,914
God, I've spent my life
scaling to the peak of-of Vought.

556
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:52,543
It's all I ever wanted.
And-and... now that I have it...

557
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:53,920
You're still not happy?

558
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:01,510
I save people, they cheer.
I fucking kill people, they cheer.

559
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,972
It's-it's meaningless.

560
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,851
Humans are nothing.
They're, they're less than nothing.

561
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,438
They're just toys for my amusement.

562
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,231
And yet they control everything.

563
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,650
It's unnatural.

564
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,278
What kind of legacy
am-am I gonna leave to my son?

565
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,949
A shithole country
in a shithole world?

566
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,032
Or something better?

567
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:27,996
Something... pure and cleansed.

568
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,831
Like... marble.

569
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,628
You do realize that probably
won't make you happy, either.

570
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,711
Still.

571
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,715
Tell me how you'd go about it.

572
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,927
Hypothetically.

573
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,431
Well... Greece,

574
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:52,561
all democracies, they fail
because people are fucking stupid.

575
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:57,693
You don't need an army of Supermen
like Nazi bae wanted... so German.

576
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,449
If you crush the masses,
who builds your monuments?

577
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,701
Who tongues your taint?

578
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,494
No.

579
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,206
The people will tear it apart themselves,

580
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,500
just got to nudge 'em a little.

581
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,295
Then you get to swoop in,
be the one saving it.

582
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,172
Like Caesar.

583
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,467
Like Caesar.

584
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,760
Statistically, it's inevitable.

585
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,358
- I'd like you to join the Seven.
- No fucking way.

586
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,318
- Why not?
- Because I'm not wearing

587
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,449
some vaguely racist super suit
in front of a bunch of clapping seals.

588
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:49,286
Plus, I'm a Black woman who is
a thousand times smarter than you.

589
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,204
Your ego can't handle it.

590
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:54,458
- I'm pretty smart myself.
- See what I mean?

591
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,168
Smart enough to listen.

592
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,213
I mean really listen to you.

593
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,050
You can stay here,

594
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,844
reeking of Taco Bell and loneliness,

595
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,806
or we can put some of your theories
into practice on a global scale.

596
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,061
When's the last time
you got a chance like that?

597
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,655
Butcher, what are you doing here?

598
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,239
Couldn't sleep.

599
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,994
What about you?

600
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,373
Um, my dad, he, uh, he had a stroke.

601
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,458
Oh, fuck.

602
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,001
I'm sorry to hear that, mate.

603
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:41,295
Just gonna grab a few things
before I get back to him.

604
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:43,965
- Is he, uh...
- I-I don't know.

605
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:53,349
He-he called me right before it happened,
and, um... I didn't pick up.

606
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,519
Why didn't I pick up?

607
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,121
I mean, maybe I could've seen it coming.

608
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,664
- I could... I could've...
- No, no, no. Hughie.

609
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,567
Don't beat yourself up about it.
There's nothing you could've done.

610
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,445
All he ever wants is to chat about some
stupid fucking James Patterson book

611
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,590
that he's reading,
and I couldn't even give him that.

612
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,742
And now they're saying
that even if he lives...

613
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,413
God.

614
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,998
Yeah, well, I know what I'd want.

615
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,085
Quick lights out.
Better than the alternative.

616
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,505
Sitting there, stewing in your mistakes...

617
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,632
as you wait out the inevitable.

618
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,820
I hope your old man pulls through.

619
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,949
Thank you. I... Oh.

620
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,038
- Hughie?
- Hey.

621
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,331
I'm so sorry.

622
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,710
I got here as soon as I could.

623
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,545
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,755
I'm okay.

625
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,400
Turn here.

626
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,400
- Right here?
- Yes.

627
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:30,405
So, what does the CIA think of you
wasting their vast resources,

628
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,532
all to hunt down the phone of Todd?

629
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,159
I didn't ask.

630
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,286
Just like I didn't ask you
to come, either.

631
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:40,123
Mm. We are here for you always, mon ami.

632
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,090
Colin?

633
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,762
Why do you ask?

634
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,722
You've been spending a lot of time...

635
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,057
together in the bathroom...

636
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,519
Sorry, I should've said something.

637
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,981
But it's complicated.

638
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,947
To be clear

639
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,490
I love you.

640
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,784
Moi aussi.

641
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,452
But you and I..

642
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,413
Are not happening.

643
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,789
I know.

644
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,585
So if Colin makes you happy...

645
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,797
Go be happy.

646
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,092
Yo, white boy spotted.

647
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,293
How's it going, Nick?
Here for the meet-up?

648
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,693
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

649
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:51,777
Cool.

650
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,594
That's a good question.

651
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,389
- What's that?
- She wonders, uh...

652
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:04,248
how a man such as this
win the love of a woman

653
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,458
like Monique, you know?

654
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,143
Oh, he's, uh,
he's nice to my daughter.

655
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,646
Come on,
there is only one reason.

656
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,132
Todd must be packing
some serious heat between his legs.

657
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,925
Seriously, Frenchie,
you did not have to come.

658
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,070
Okay, I'm only saying,

659
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:20,389
the man has some serious
Pete Davidson energy over there, no?

660
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,106
- You recognize her?
- Not sure.

661
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,942
Hi, fellas. Thanks for making it
on such short notice.

662
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,195
He's here, right?
Like, in the building here?

663
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,699
This is the best day of my life.

664
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,367
Yeah.

665
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,500
Well, you know, Dirk, I'm not actually
holding my breath underwater.

666
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,418
I'm technically breathing underwater.

667
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,338
So it's more impressive.

668
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,630
Mmm. A-Train, try these
buffalo ranch bacon blasters.

669
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,715
They're juicy.

670
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,675
Sage.

671
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,260
It's good to see you again.

672
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,025
What the fuck
are you doing here?

673
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,182
Homelander's tired of being
surrounded by morons.

674
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,103
- Hello, everyone.
- Homelander!

675
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,023
I just want to say, it's a huge honor
to be here with you.

676
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,648
Right. Now, I can't stay long,

677
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,362
but I heard that you are
some of my biggest fans,

678
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,822
supporting me
when others turned their backs.

679
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,782
I just wanted to personally say...

680
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:25,621
thank you for your devotion
and your sacrifice.

681
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:31,585
W... Well, really, it's you
who gives so much to...

682
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,797
You people are more than just fans.

683
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,717
You're martyrs
to the greatest cause on Earth.

684
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,969
- Open it.
- You got it.

685
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,807
Whoa. Bats.

686
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,141
Yeah.

687
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,563
I want you to take these bats

688
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,023
and beat these gentlemen to death.

689
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,869
You're funny.

690
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:09,039
Oh, it's like one of your tests.
You want us to say no.

691
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,375
No, Deep.

692
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,085
This is not a test.

693
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:20,927
I want you to beat
these gentlemen to death... now.

694
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,016
I think maybe we should go.

695
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:30,728
Oh, Jesus!

696
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:32,813
Mm-hmm.

697
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,150
Oh, shit.

698
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,530
Jesus!

699
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,043
Stay here.

700
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,420
Wait for further instructions.

701
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:10,643
Yo, what the fuck?
That was so fucked-up, you guys.

702
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,190
What the fuck is he doing here?

703
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,862
He should be at his trial, no?

704
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,155
Shit.

705
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,385
This exclusive live footage

706
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,913
of Homelander arriving
at the courthouse just now.

707
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,498
The verdict will be read any moment.

708
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,208
So stay with us
after these important messages.

709
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,521
Are you ready to stop reusing
your catheter and start living your life?

710
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,353
The verdict's coming.

711
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,105
Jurors are seated. Any second.

712
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,829
Not guilty!

713
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,547
Fuck you, fascist!

714
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,494
From outside the courthouse

715
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,913
where the jury has returned a verdict.

716
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,557
- Homelander is not guilty of murder.
- Go.

717
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,710
The scene outside
the courthouse is chaotic.

718
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,588
- Homelander and Starlight supporters out en masse...
- You got this.

719
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,090
- Go. Go.
- Okay, okay.

720
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,675
what was a peaceful demonstration
has turned violent.

721
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,596
We urge everyone: Stay home...

722
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,896
Colin...

723
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,777
Colin!

724
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,659
You all right?

725
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,875
Colin. Colin. No, no! It's me.

726
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,585
It's me. Come on.

727
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,047
- I'm-I'm okay. I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

728
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,672
No. Are you all right?

729
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,800
Sorry, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

730
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:52,614
Everyone, remain calm.
We're all very special people.

731
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,576
Stop it. Stop.

732
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,469
Everybody, please, please go home!

733
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,304
We can fight but not like this!

734
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,014
Annie! Annie!

735
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,766
Bitch!

736
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,601
- Fucking traitor!
- Hey! Get off of her.

737
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,606
Get off of her!
Get off of her.

738
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,150
Kiara.

739
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,612
Kiara. Kiara?

740
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,782
Oh, God. Help!
Help, someone help.

741
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,327
Help, please.

742
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,661
Kiara.

743
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,586
Excuse me, pardon me.

744
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,670
I saw it myself.

745
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,547
It was the Starlighters, man.

746
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,599
Please return to your homes.

747
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:03,186
Please exit the facility
in an orderly fashion.

748
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,106
Please exit the facility
in an orderly fashion.

749
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,400
Please return to your homes.

750
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,989
Justice prevailed today

751
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,576
as the jury in Homelander's murder trial
handed down a not-guilty verdict.

752
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,829
But that moment of national healing
was cut tragically short.

753
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:26,793
Violent attacks by Starlight supporters
left three innocent patriots dead.

754
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:30,630
Out of respect, we are gonna wait
until all families have been notified

755
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,798
before we release
the names of the victims.

756
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,092
But we know
that each of them gave their lives

757
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,512
exercising their constitutional right...

758
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,139
No, let her sleep.

759
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,451
I'll come by first thing in the morning,
we'll tell her together.

760
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,768
Yeah.

761
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,411
that have saved us
over and over

762
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,105
and over, without asking
anything in return.

763
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,440
Folks...

764
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,574
Our only solace is that Homelander will
remain free to protect us all.

765
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:03,286
Now that this endless
miscarriage of justice is behind him,

766
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:05,706
Homelander can return his focus
to what really matters...

767
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,809
- standing up for the good guys.
- You gonna finish that?

768
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,585
- True Americans.
- Oh, come on, buddy.

769
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,713
We're supposed to be celebrating.

770
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,510
What's wrong?

771
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,387
No, it... it's nothing.

772
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:23,474
Come on, now.
We-we talked about this.

773
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,518
We have to share
everything with each other,

774
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:32,233
do everything together,
until we almost merge into one.

775
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,989
So, you tell me, son.
Whatever it is, it's-it's okay.

776
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,451
I don't want Butcher to die.

777
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,128
But even after he abandoned you like that?

778
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,547
That was brutal.

779
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,257
And all those things he said about you.

780
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,427
He said awful, awful things about you.

781
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,304
Just horrible.

782
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,309
My mom loved him.

783
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,614
But what about you?

784
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:42,302
Noir was right,
that was so fucked-up.

785
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,679
You have every right
to be upset.

786
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,766
I'm upset for you.

787
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,226
What if we just left?

788
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,773
We could vanish under the waves forever.

789
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,652
Everyone there loves you for you.

790
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:02,114
As the sweet, sensitive,
really strong swimmer you are.

791
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,244
Look at me.

792
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,621
Baby, look at me.

793
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,293
We wouldn't have to hide our love anymore.

794
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:18,297
We could just be Kevin and Ambrosius.

795
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,572
Mm.

796
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:35,166
Hey, so,
I just finished reading Deadly Cross.

797
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,043
I mean,
how does Patterson do it?

798
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,463
I liked it even more than
Criss Cross, Cross Justice,

799
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,340
Double Cross, Triple Cross,

800
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:48,219
Cross Fire, Cross Country,
Cross the Line, even Cross My Heart.

801
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:53,726
You know, so, anyway, lots to talk about.
Uh, give me a call. I love you, son.

802
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,695
You get better, okay?

803
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:11,494
You get better, and I will
talk to you for hours about Deadly Cross.

804
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:14,246
You can read the whole
fucking book to me if you want.

805
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,541
Deal?

806
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,213
I really hope you can hear me.

807
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,760
For what it's worth,
I think he can.

808
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,103
Mom?

809
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,152
Billy.

810
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,324
You promised me
you would take care of Ryan.

811
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,496
Bloody hell, what'd you think
I'm trying to do here?

812
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:00,333
I think you're
about to fuck over Hughie, again.

813
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,710
And it's going to blow up
in your face, again.

814
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:06,422
I saved the kid, at the Tower, didn't I?

815
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,927
I had a clean shot at Homelander,
game, set and fucking match,

816
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,762
but I chose to save him.

817
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,516
And look where it got us.

818
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,061
You promised me.

819
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:25,067
If Ryan becomes like Homelander,
that's the end of the world.

820
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:29,989
Don't you think I know that?

821
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,240
You have to find a better way.

822
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,121
What the hell do you want from me, Becca?

823
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,420
Be the man that I married.

824
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,264
That man died a long time ago.

825
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,434
It's too late.

826
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,686
I'm out of time...

827
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,175
Oh, for fuck's sake.

828
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,559
Well, I hope you're happy now.
